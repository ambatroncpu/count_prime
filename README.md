this is still not the perfect version tho im currently have a heahache rn also im still new tho so font used it but my recommendation is that you can use 6k-1 and 6k+1 to check if its a prime because all prime
except 2 and 3 is in this form and just make it if the number that you use to divide is more than sqrt of the number that you checking just stop the brake so it can run faster
